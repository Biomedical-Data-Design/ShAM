Shapley Anything Model 

Author: Mike (Siyu) Wang, Kuai Yu, Ishan Kalburge
## Overview
```
Documentation: contains steps for inpainting for generative inpainting pytorch and using Rockfish.

Quadrant-based Feature Reduction: contains files for running Quadrant-based approach for shapley value calculation.

The Shapley Anything Model: contains files for running SAM-based shapley value calculation

VAE_GAN_experiment: contains files for VAE and GAN for studying data distribution.

superpixel_experiment: contains files for using skimage superpixel

```
* Details for using `quadrant-based Feature Reduction` and `The Shapley Anything Model` is inside each folder
* We give credit to the authors of generative-inpainting model as well as h-shap prediction model based on BBBC041. The detailed link to those directory could be found in [Inpainting Model](https://github.com/daa233/generative-inpainting-pytorch) and [h-shap](https://github.com/Sulam-Group/h-shap)
